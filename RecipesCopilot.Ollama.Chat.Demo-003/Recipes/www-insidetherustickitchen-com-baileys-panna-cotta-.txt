Bailey’s Panna Cotta

[Description]
Panna Cotta is the easiest dessert to prepare. It takes less than 10 minutes of prep work then it’s poured into moulds and left to set in the fridge.
Not only is it easy but mio dio (my god) is it delicious! A classic Italian dessert with a fun festive twist.
And even though we’re using Bailey’s it’s the kind of dessert that can be made all year round for any occasion, whether it’s just a cosy night in, Valentine’s day, Christmas or if you’re hosting a dinner party.

Milk – use whole milk for best flavour.
Cream – you must use heavy cream (known as double cream in the UK). Don’t go for a low fat version.
Sugar – use caster sugar (superfine) if possible, if not granulated will do.
Vanilla – I used vanilla bean paste but you can also use extract or a whole vanilla bean.
Gelatine – I tested this recipe with gelatine powder and used 4 teaspoons (12g sarchet) which is the equivelant to 3 gelatin leaves.
Bailey’s – of course you can use any brand of Irish cream liqueur.
Dark chocolate – not in the photo above but I like to grate some dark chocolate over the top before serving (this is optional).

[Step by step recipe instructions]
Step 1 – Put the milk, cream and vanilla in a medium-sized pot and bring to a boil. As soon as it starts boiling turn off the heat (don’t leave it unattended or it’ll boil over and overflow) (photo 1).
Step 2 – Add the sugar and stir until the sugar has completely dissolved. Add the Bailey’s and stir to combine (photos 2 & 3).
Step 3 – Next, sprinkle in the gelatin and whisk so there are no lumps, stir until the gelatin has completely dissolved (photo 4).
Step 5 – Pour the panna cotta into moulds, ramekins or small serving dishes. Once cool, put them in the fridge for at least 6 hours to set (photos 5 & 6).

[Recipe tips and FAQs]
Read gelatine instructions – make sure to read your packet instructions before using. Some gelatine brands tell you to bloom the gelatine in a little water before using. The gelatine we used can be sprinkled straight into the liquid.
Moulds vs serving dishes – you can pour the panna cotta into serving dishes like the ones we used (see photos), ramekins or pour them into moulds.
How to remove panna cotta from a mould – pour hot water into a large bowl, hold the panna cotta mould in the hot water for 3-4 seconds then invert onto a plate. If it doesn’t slide out, hold it in the water for a few more seconds and repeat. DO NOT hold them in hot water for too long or they will melt.
Can I make this without gelatine? If you don’t want to use gelatine you’ll need to use a vegetarian or vegan alternative like agar so the panna cotta sets.  How long do they take to set? You need to refrigerate them for at least 6-8 hours to set.  Can I make this in advance? Yes, it’s the perfect make-ahead dessert. You can make the panna cotta the night before or up to 2-3 days in advance.
