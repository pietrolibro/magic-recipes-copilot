Chocolate Salami

[Description]
Chocolate Salami is such a fun dessert to make during the festive season. Loaded with chocolatey goodness, Amaretti cookies and nuts then dusted with powdered sugar for a realistic look. Super fun and so easy to make plus it’s egg-free!
Everyone loves some fun baking during the festivities and what could be more fun than a realistic-looking Salami made entirely from chocolate, cookies and nuts?
Better yet it’s actually super easy to make, like ridiculously easy so it’s perfect for getting the whole family involved. The only hard part is patiently waiting for it to set in the fridge so it can be dusted in powdered sugar and sliced.
And although this makes the perfect foodie gift for Christmas you can make this all year round and enjoy a slice when you need that chocolate fix!

[Ingredients]
Here are the ingredients you need to make this recipe; dark chocolate (70% cocoa), butter, milk, Amaretti cookies (crunchy ones not soft), unsweetened cacao powder, hazelnuts, pistachios and powdered sugar for dusting.
If you want to go a step further and tie the salami you’ll need basic kitchen string. See the photo below that shows all the ingredients you need!

[Step by step recipe instructions]
Break the chocolate into rough pieces and place in a large mixing bowl with the butter. Place the bowl on top of a saucepan filled with hot water making sure that the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl.
Keep the pan on a medium heat making sure that the water does not boil. Stir the butter and chocolate every so often until completely melted and smooth (photo 1).
Meanwhile, add the Amaretti cookies to a ziploc bag and crush to small-medium sized pieces using a rolling pin (photo 2).
Remove the bowl from the heat and slowly add the milk whilst stirring until totally combined. Next add the cacao powder and salt and stir it into the chocolate, don’t worry if there are a few lumps (photos 3 & 4).
Add the crushed cookies and nuts and stir until completely coated in the chocolate mixture (photos 5 & 6).
Tip the mixture onto a sheet of baking parchment into a rough log shape. You want to place the mixture at the end closest to you so you can roll it up (photo 7).
Fold the baking parchment right over the chocolate forming it into a log shape. Roll it a couple of times twisting in each end to secure it. I also like to wrap it again in plastic wrap for a neater shape but that’s optional (photos 9 & 10).
Place in the fridge for 4-6 hours or overnight. Once firm lightly dust it in powdered sugar for a realistic look (photo 11).

See instructions below for tying the salami with kitchen string (optional).

How to tie the salami – make it look realistic

Top tip: Here, you’ll find complete step by step instructions for tying the chocolate salami. It’s one of those things that when written down, sound very complicated but it’s actually very straightforward. For a more visual representation watch our video tutorial!
Make a small loop with one end of the string and tie a knot to secure it (photos 12).
Tie the string around the salami once and pass the other end of the string through the first loop and pull it tightly making sure the knot is underneath the salami (photos 13).
Bring the piece of string up and over the end of the salami and tuck it underneath the top piece of string (photo 14).
Next, pull the string down around 1 inch from the first loop and use your thumb to hold it in place (photo 15).
Whilst holding the string in place loop it right around the salami and tuck it underneath your thumb to secure it making sure to pull firmly. Repeat another 4-5 times or until you reach the end of the salami (photos 16 & 17).
Once you’re at the end of the salami wrap the string right over that end and tuck it under the pieces of string on the bottom. Tie a knot to secure it (photos 18-20).

[Recipe tips and FAQs]
Nuts – I like to keep the nuts whole so you get nice slices throughout the salami when you cut it. If you don’t have pistachios and hazelnuts then peanuts, cashews or almonds would also work well.Adding the milk – make sure to add the milk slowly stirring vigorously in-between additions. Don’t add it all in at once or there’s a chance the chocolate could split. I tend to add the milk in 3 goes. If your chocolate has split check out my tip below to save it you don’t need to throw it out!Liqueur – if you’re not serving this to children try adding in 1 tbsp of your favourite liqueur.
Can you freeze chocolate salami? Yes, this freezes really well just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or baking parchment and aluminium foil.  What can I use instead of Amaretti cookies? You can use any type of dry cookies such as digestive biscuits (UK) or graham crackers.  My chocolate has split, what can I do? Don’t throw it out, it can be saved! Warm up around 1/4 cup (60ml) of milk (note it should be warm not piping hot). Gradually add a splash at a time into the chocolate mixture whilst stirring. Once you see the mixture coming back together stop adding the milk.  

Serving suggestions:
This is such a fun dessert to serve up after a meal. I like to serve it with a liqueur such as Vin Santo but it’ll go just as well with coffee or for children, a glass of milk!
