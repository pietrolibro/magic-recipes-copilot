Sicilian Cannoli

[Description]
How to make authentic tasting Sicilian Cannoli at home! This recipe will show you how to make the best homemade cannoli shells that are crispy, sweet and delicious filled with a classic ricotta filling.
Is there anything better than freshly made cannoli? Crispy and flaky shells fried until bubbly and golden and filled with a classic sweet ricotta filling, pure dessert heaven!
Alongside Cassata, these pastries are one of Sicily’s most iconic desserts and can be found in Sicilian bakeries all over the world. Traditionally they’re garnished with candied orange peel at each end or chopped pistachio nuts (Bronte pistachios from Sicily if you can get them).
Cannoli, just like Bomboloni are a labour intensive dessert but they are SO worth the effort. They’re perfect for a special treat, to end a family feast or for occasions like Easter or Christmas.
Our recipe shows you how to make both the shells and filling from scratch. The shells are the most time-consuming part (but not difficult) and in my opinion well worth making but if you’re short on time you can use the filling with store-bought shells.
Check out our step by step recipe below with tips, photos and helpful video tutorial for making the most delicious homemade cannoli.

[Ingredients]
Italian 00 or AP flour – you can use either Italian 00 flour which is traditionally used or regular all-purpose flour.
Sugar – white granulated or caster sugar will both work.
Cocoa powder – a tiny amount is added for colour, if you don’t have any you can leave it out.
Cinnamon – just a pinch is added for flavour.
Butter – make sure your butter is cold straight from the fridge.
Egg – make sure to use a large egg.
Marsala wine – this is an important ingredient for flavour and sweetness. You can also use white wine.
White wine vinegar – an important ingredient to help create light and crispy shells.
Ricotta – you need a lot of ricotta (about 4 cups/1 kg) and it must be drained in advance or it’ll be too soft for filing.
Powdered sugar – mixed into the ricotta for a delicious sweet flavour. You can easily adjust the amount to taste.
Citrus zest – you can add the zest of a lemon or orange into the ricotta filling for extra flavour (optional).
Candied orange peel – traditionally Sicilian cannoli are garnished with strips of candied orange at each end.
Sunflower oil – for deep frying the shells. You can also use another flavourless oil such as vegetable oil.

Essential equipment

Cannoli tubes – I use metal cannoli tubes, you can easily find them online.
Candy thermometer – it’s SO important to know the temperature of your oil and keep it consistent. Too hot or cold will affect the end result.
Pasta machine or rolling pin – a pasta machine makes things easy but you can also use a rolling pin to roll your dough.
Kitchen paper – you need to drain the cannoli shells after frying to remove any excess oil.
Tongs – you need tongs to add and remove the cannoli from the oil.

[Step by step recipe instructions]
Important Tip! Before starting, place the ricotta in a sieve over a bowl and store it in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight if possible. It’s important to drain the ricotta or it’ll be too soft for filling the cannoli once mixed with the sugar.

Making the cannoli dough

Add the flour, sugar, cinnamon and cocoa powder to a large bowl and mix together until thoroughly combined (photo 1).
Cut the cold butter into cubes then work it into the flour mixture with your finger until it resembles breadcrumbs (photos 2 & 3).
Make a well in the middle of flour and add the beaten egg, vinegar and marsala. Mix everything together with a fork until a rough dough forms (photo 4).
Tip the dough onto a clean work surface and knead for 7-10 minutes. This is the secret to getting all those bubbles in your cannoli shells (photo 5).
Once kneaded, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Alternatively, you can leave the dough overnight (photo 6).
Set up your pasta machine then heat a large pot of oil to 356F (180C) using a candy thermometer.
Lightly dust your work surface and pasta machine with flour. Cut your dough in half then flatten your ball of dough so it can fit through the widest setting of your pasta machine (usually number 0) (photo 7).

Rolling out the dough

Pass the dough through the widest setting then fold one end of the dough over the other (photos 8 & 9). Pass the dough through the widest setting again and repeat 3-4 times (photo 10).
Now your dough is ready for rolling, pass the dough through the second widest setting (usually number 1) and continue until the dough is half ⅛ inch thick (2mm). If using a Marcato Atlas pasta machine this is number 6 (photo 10 & 11).

Rolling pin method (optional)

If you don’t have a pasta machine you can simply roll the dough out with a rolling pin on a light floured surface until very thin (⅛ inch if possible).

Shaping

Cut out rounds using a 4-5 inch round cutter (you can make them smaller or bigger if you like). Working in batches, wrap the cut-out dough around a cannoli tube using a tiny dot of egg white to seal (photos 12-14).
Carefully, fry the cannoli in the hot oil (in batches) until golden brown and puffed up. Drain on kitchen paper. If you don’t have many cannoli tubes, be careful they aren’t too hot before re-using (photo 15 & 16).

How to make the filling

Put the drained ricotta and powdered sugar in a mixing bowl and mix together until combined (photos 17-19).
Fill a piping bag with the mixture and pipe it into the cannoli shells. Add a slice of candied orange to each end, serve (photo 20).

Filling options and variations

There are many ways to fill your homemade cannoli, I like the not overly sweet ricotta just with a hint of orange or lemon zest mixed in but you can also fold in chocolate chips, chopped up candied fruit or nuts.
You can also dip the ends of the cannoli shells in melted chocolate just like I did in our mini cannoli recipe. Then you can dip the ends in chopped nuts like pistachios or hazelnuts.

[Recipe tips and FAQs]
Measuring your flour – if you are using cups instead of a kitchen scale make sure to spoon the flour into the cups and level it off with a knife for best results.
Draining the ricotta – it’s so important to drain the ricotta for at least 4 hours or overnight if possible so a lot of the excess liquid is removed before filling.
Resting the dough – make sure you let the dough rest in the fridge to let the gluten relax before rolling out (30 mins to 1 hour).
Rolling out the dough – it’s important that you roll the dough out very thin or the shells will be too thick and soft instead of crispy.
Size and shape of the cannoli – I find that a 4-5 inch round cutter works best but if you don’t have one you can cut the dough into squares instead.
Sealing the edges – use a small amount of egg white to seal the edges of the dough but be careful not to get it on the cannoli tubes or the dough will stick to them.
Fry in batches – don’t add too many cannoli to the oil at once of the oil will cool down. You also don’t want to overcrowd the pan.
How do I get air bubbles in the cannoli shells? You must knead the dough for around 10 minutes just as you would with pasta dough. It creates tiny little bubbles throughout the dough that bubble up when fried.  Can I prepare these in advance? You can prepare everything in advance (store the filling in the fridge) but do not fill the cannoli more than 30 mins to 1 hour before serving or the shells will soften too much.  How long do the cannoli shells last? The cannoli shells will keep well for 1-2 weeks in a sealed container  How do I stop my cannoli shells from going soggy? If you follow our recipe your cannoli shells will be extra crispy and crunchy but make sure you fill them right before serving (I like to keep a piping bag filled in the fridge). If you fill them too far in advance they will start to turn soggy.
