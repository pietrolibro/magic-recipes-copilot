Carbonade Valdostana

[Description]
Carbonade Valdostana is a rich and hearty beef stew from the Aosta Valley. This delicious wintery dish is made with a whole bottle of red wine, festive spices such as cinnamon and cloves, herbs and onions. It’s perfect for a cosy night in, served with creamy polenta.

The Aosta Valley, situated in the Italian Alps is well known for its rustic, hearty and comforting dishes such as Zuppa alla Valpellinese and Fontina cheese risotto.
Carbonade or Carbonada (not to be confused with Carbonara) is another great example of Aostan comfort food.
Traditionally made with beef preserved in salt this dish is full of flavour from red wine, herbs and incredible fragrant spices.
It’s served on a bed of creamy polenta which is so worth making it just makes this dish extra comforting. Alternatively, mashed potatoes would work really well.
Below, is our favourite way of making it. To get as close to the authentic dish as possible use a red wine from the Aosta Valley such as Torette but a good northern Italian wine will work really well. We used Barbera d’Asti.

[Ingredients]
Beef brisket or chuck – if using beef chuck make sure it has enough fat marbling through it so it’s not too lean. 
Italian red wine – Use a northern Italian red wine if possible, we used Barbera d’Asti.
White onions – you can also use brown onions.
Cloves, juniper berries and nutmeg – these add so much warmth and flavour.
Sage and bay leaf – I love sage in this dish, some recipes add fresh thyme.
Flour – this is to coat the beef and help thicken the sauce slightly.
Butter – Carbonade is traditionally cooked in butter as is a lot of northern Italian dishes. Butter can burn easily so you can add a drizzle of olive oil to stop that happening.

Brown the beef – Salt the beef well then lightly dust it in flour making sure to shake off any excess. Melt half of the butter with a drizzle of oil in a Dutch oven and brown the meat in batches on both sides, remove to a plate (photos 1-3).
Saute the onions – when the beef is done, add the other half of the butter and another drizzle of oil to the pot. Add the sliced onions with all the herbs and spices and saute, stirring often until softened (photos 4 and 5).
Add beef and wine – add the beef back to the pot with all its juices and add a splash of red wine. Let it bubble and deglaze the pot, scraping any brown bits from the bottom. Add the rest of the wine and cover the pot with a lid leaving it slightly ajar. Cook for 2 hours (photos 6-8).
Uncover – after 2 hours uncover the pot and cook for a further 30 minutes until reduced slightly. Serve with creamy polenta or mashed potatoes (photos 9 and 10).
