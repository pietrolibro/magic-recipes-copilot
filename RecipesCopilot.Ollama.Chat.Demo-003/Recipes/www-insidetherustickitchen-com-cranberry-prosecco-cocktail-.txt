[Title]
Christmas Spiced Cranberry and Prosecco cocktail

[Description]
It’s Christmas! Time for indulging in delicious food and making fun cocktails! This year we’ve been making this Cranberry and Prosecco cocktail and it’s so festive and delicious.
Made with a simple Christmas spiced cranberry juice and Amarena cherry syrup it’s sour, tart and sweet with a delicious hint of cinnamon, cloves and cherries (it’s sooo good!).
Other than Prosecco there’s no additional alcohol in this so it’s deliciously drinkable (much like a Mimosa or Bellini) and the perfect first drink to serve at festive parties, brunches of Christmas Day itself, Buon Natale!

[Ingredients]
To Make this Christmas Spiced Cranberry and Prosecco cocktail all you need is Cranberry juice, Amarena cherry syrup, Prosecco and Christmas spices (cinnamon stick, cloves and star anise). 

Ingredient notes and substitutions

Cranberry juice – I don’t recommend specific brands very often but I do love using Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice for this. I find other brands especially those labelled ‘juice drink’ too sweet.
Amarena cherries – If you can get your hands on Fabbri Amarena cherries I highly recommend buying them. You can find them online or in Italian food stores although any Amarena cherries will do. If you buy a jar you can use the cherries to make our Amarena Cherry Chocolate Ice Cream or Ice Cream Stuffed Mini Panettones and use the remaining syrup to make this cocktail (win-win).
Spices – cinnamon stick, star anise, cloves. All these spices must be whole you can’t use ground spices for this.
Orange zest – a strip of orange zest looks so pretty as a cocktail garnish and adds a nice aroma to the drink. You can leave it out if you prefer.

[Step by step recipe instructions]
Add the cranberry juice and spices to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Once simmering turn off the heat and let it cool completely.
Add ice to a tall tumbler or wine glass. Add 4 tablespoons (60ml) of spiced cranberry juice and two tablespoons of Amarena cherry syrup. Top up with Prosecco and serve.

[Recipe tips and FAQs]
Let the juice cool – it’s important to let the infused cranberry juice cool completely before making the cocktail.
Keep the Prosecco chilled – another important note is to make sure the Prosecco is nice and chilled in the fridge before making the cocktail.
Prepare it in advance – you can make the infused cranberry juice up to a few days in advance so all you need to do when you’re ready to serve is mix everything together. 
Serving – I recommend making the cocktail right before serving as you want it cold and extra bubbly.
Optional garnish – you can add a twist of orange zest into each glass as garnish (what we have done) but whole cranberries would also work well.
