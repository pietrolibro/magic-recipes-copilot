burrata cheese appetizer

[Description]
The creamiest burrata cheese appetizer topped with Parmigiano Reggiano, crispy ‘Nduja, and zesty gremolata. Spread it on char-grilled ciabatta bread for the ultimate Italian-inspired appetizer!
It’s creamy, cheesy, spicy, and zesty all at the same time and just so addictive that you’ll be making it over and over (no exaggeration).
If you’re not familiar with burrata it’s made of an outer shell of mozzarella and filled with stracciatella cream (a creamy cow’s milk cheese). 
It’s super indulgent, creamy and SO delicious, if you haven’t tried it yet you need to fix that asap.  You should be able to find burrata in larger supermarkets or Italian food stores.
As for ‘Nduja? It’s an ingredient you have to get your hands on. It’s a Calabrian spicy spreadable salami that’s cured so you don’t need to cook it and can spread it on slices of bread as a snack.
You can use it to top pizzas (see our Nduja Pizza recipe), add to pasta sauces like our Shrimp Spaghetti with ‘Nduja and Lemon, or in ways like this! I fry it just for a couple of minutes so it crisps up slightly then drizzle it over the creamy burrata, I know, it’s SO good!
Although there are a couple of speciality ingredients in this recipe it’s super simple and takes no more than 10 minutes to prepare plus it is so impressive. Serve this up to guests and they are guaranteed to be blown away. 

[Ingredients]
To make this recipe you’ll need burrata cheese, ‘Nduja (spreadable salami), Parmigiano Reggiano, parsley, lemon zest, and garlic.
See the photo below that shows you all of the ingredients you need!

[Step by step recipe instructions]
Put the garlic, parsley and lemon zest in a small pile on a cutting board and finely chop it until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. A Mezzaluna (half-moon) Italian knife makes this super easy but you could also use a knife (photos 1-4).
Drizzle a little olive oil in a non stick pan and fry the ‘Nduja until slightly crispy (about 2-3 minutes) (photos 5 & 6).
Arrange the burrata cheese on a serving plate and top with a grated Parmigiano Reggiano, a couple of spoonfuls of ‘Nduja, and then sprinkle over some gremolata (photos 7 & 8).
Serve with chargrilled ciabatta bread.
